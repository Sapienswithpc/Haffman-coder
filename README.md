# Haffman-coding
haffman encode&amp;decode (C++)

## Usage
Before you run the code, prepare **text.txt** with texts you want to encode.
- If you choose **encode**,  **encoded.txt** and **haffman_key.txt** will be created. You can see the every encoded characters in **haffman_key.txt**.
- If you choose **decode**, there will be **decoded.txt**, which is exactly same as **text.txt**
